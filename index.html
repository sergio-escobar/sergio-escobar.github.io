    		<h3 style="background-color: white;">I was born on December 1st, 2002. I was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. I currently live in Riverdale, Maryland. I have three younger siblings. I am the oldest of four. I aspire to become a pediatrician even though I know that it's going to take a lot of time and effort and dedication. I really like working with kids so much. They make me really happy and I have always loved helping kids.</h3>
